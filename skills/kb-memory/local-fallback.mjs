// local-fallback.mjs — durable local fallback for a kb-memory entry that could not reach its ledger.
//
// ORIGIN (2026-08-18): this lived inline inside reflect.mjs, written for exactly one caller (its own
// --commit loop, which spawns mem.mjs as a child process and catches a non-zero exit). Extracted here
// (2026-08-18, same day, the agent-seat credential bootstrap fix) so mem.mjs's OWN direct CLI writes
// can use the IDENTICAL safety net -- a human or agent typing `mem.mjs status "..." --agent cro`
// straight into a shell got NO fallback at all before this: only content that happened to route
// through reflect.mjs's LLM-distillation loop was ever protected. Both callers now import from here;
// reflect.mjs re-exports both names unchanged so its own already-shipped tests (which import them
// `from "../reflect.mjs"`) keep passing without modification.
//
// Same directory mem.mjs's own local write-through cache already uses (~/.claude/kb-cache), so a
// human or a recovery script has one place to look, not a new ad hoc path per failure class. One file
// per agent so a recovery pass can be run per-agent without cross-agent interference.

 * `item` is `{ type, text, share?, tags?, _fallback? }`; `source` (default "reflect.mjs", preserving
 * the exact behavior every existing caller/test already depends on) names WHICH caller lost the write,
 * so a recovery pass and a human reading the file both know where to look for the reason. Never throws
 * -- if even the local fallback file cannot be written (e.g. a read-only home dir), that is reported
 * to stderr rather than swallowed a second time; there is nowhere further to degrade to.

    // share:true and therefore visible across lanes. Redaction is idempotent, so a caller that has
    // already redacted (mem.mjs does, to print the same string) loses nothing by passing through
