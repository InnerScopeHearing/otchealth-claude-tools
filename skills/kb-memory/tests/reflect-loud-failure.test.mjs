// Tests for reflect.mjs's fail-loud + durable-local-fallback behavior.
//
// Two SEPARATE failure classes live in this one file, and this test file now covers both:
//
// (1) 2026-08-18: a mem.mjs COMMIT-write failure (during --commit) used to vanish silently.
//     reflect.mjs is Stop-hook-friendly and always resolves to exit 0 for THIS failure class by
//     design (a best-effort memory distiller must never block a session ending over a write it
//     could not make). Before the fix, mem.mjs's own stderr was thrown away (`stdio: "ignore"`),
//     the catch logged one generic line, and on the "stop" hook path even that line is piped to
//     /dev/null by kb-inject.sh's own invocations of this script. So a session could end clean
//     while every distilled lesson silently vanished. These tests pin the fix at the unit level
//     (the fallback file itself); end-to-end proof (a forced Azure write failure producing the
//     loud banner + a populated fallback file, then a clean run with no failure once
//     BLOB_BACKEND=s3 succeeded) is in that PR's description, captured from a real run rather
//     than simulated here.
//
// (2) 2026-08-28: the LLM STEP ITSELF failing (missing/invalid credentials, an unreachable
//     provider, a malformed response) used to be INDISTINGUISHABLE from "the model ran and found
//     no lessons" -- both printed the same "reflect: no new durable lessons." and exited 0. This
//     is a DIFFERENT failure class from (1): it is about the reflection never happening at all,
//     not about a real lesson failing to persist. reflect.mjs now surfaces it via a distinct
//     stderr message and a NON-ZERO exit (see distill()'s own header comment in reflect.mjs for
//     the exact contract). Tested below via distill() directly, with an injected chatFn -- the
//     same dependency-injection convention this skill's nightly-reflection.mjs test file already
//     uses for its own distillAgent() -- so no test here ever touches a network call, a real
//     OpenAI/Azure credential, or a real mem.mjs write.
