// s3-blob.mjs — dependency-free (no aws-sdk) S3 object-store client for the kb-memory ledgers.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-18). mem.mjs / semantic.mjs / kb-journal.mjs / blob-lease.mjs /
// ledger-archive.mjs / memory-librarian.mjs all talk to Azure Blob directly via a hand-rolled
// account-key SAS. As of today every one of those storage accounts (otchealthcommons,
// otchealthcfodata, otchealthlegalstore) has been placed into a WRITE-BLOCKED state: every PUT
// returns `403 AuthorizationPermissionMismatch`, while GET/LIST still succeed (verified live,
// 2026-08-18 — see the PR description for the three-account probe). This is NOT "the subscription
// vanished" (a prior note describing it that way is imprecise); it reads exactly like an
// account-wide read-only lock applied as an Azure-exit step, kept around so the OLD data stays
// inspectable during the cutover. Whatever the precise mechanism, the practical fact is unconditional
// and permanent from this codebase's point of view: writes never succeed there again.
//
// otchealth-mcp-server (the gateway) hit the identical wall and already built + deployed the fix:
// an S3 mirror, `src/legal/s3-blob-store.ts`, with an explicit (account, container) -> (bucket,
// keyPrefix) allow-list, `BLOB_BACKEND=s3` live in production. This file is a deliberate, faithful
// PORT of that module's S3 wire protocol (the MIRROR table, the SigV4 signing, the single-encode-only
// S3 URI quirk, the 404/403-vs-loud-failure contracts) into this repo's plain-JS, dependency-free
// style, so a write from mem.mjs and a write from the gateway's `memory_remember` land in the SAME
// physical S3 objects — one ledger, two writers, not a fork. Re-sync the MIRROR table below whenever
// otchealth-mcp-server's src/legal/s3-blob-store.ts adds/changes a row; it is the authoritative source.
//
// CREDENTIALS: reuses aws-secret.mjs's awsCreds() (ECS task role -> AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/SECRET ->
// OTC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/SECRET) so this file adds no NEW credential-bootstrap path. Key Vault is
// deliberately NOT consulted here for AWS keys: Key Vault itself lives in the same locked-down Azure
// estate, so an AWS-creds-from-Key-Vault fallback would be circular exactly when it is needed most.
//
// CONTRACTS (mirrors s3-blob-store.ts exactly, so callers can treat this as a drop-in):
//   getTextFromS3(account, container, path)   -> string | null (null ONLY on 404). Throws loud on
//                                                 any other failure — a 403 must never read as "empty".
//   listBlobsFromS3(account, container, prefix) -> [{name,size,lastModified,etag}] (name relative to
//                                                 the prefix). Throws on any failure OTHER than a
//                                                 clean "prefix has zero objects" 200 response.
//   putObjectToS3(account, container, path, bodyBuffer, contentType, extraHeaders?) -> {etag}. Throws
//                                                 on any non-2xx (a 412/409 conflict included — the
