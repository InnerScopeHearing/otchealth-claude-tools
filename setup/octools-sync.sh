# octools-sync.sh — in-session AUTO-refresh of the shared toolkit (the live-pull half of octools-version).
#
# Why: session-start.sh force-syncs the toolkit to origin/main AT SESSION START. A long-running session
# that began before a fix/SOP was merged keeps the OLD copy until it restarts (this caused the "the CTO
# changed something and the other agents are not connected to it" fragmentation). Wired as a
# UserPromptSubmit hook, this makes a running agent pick up changes to claude-tools/main on its NEXT
# prompt, with no restart and no lost context. main is the single source of truth; every agent re-pulls it.
#
# Safe by design: the auto-reset is throttled (default 300s, no per-message latency) and GUARDED to /tmp
# so it can NEVER reset a real working checkout (the CTO's own claude-tools checkout is left alone). The
# fleet-bulletin surfacing runs in any session. Always exits 0 so it can never block a prompt.
