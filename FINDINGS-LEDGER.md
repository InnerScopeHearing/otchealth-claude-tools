# Findings Ledger

Durable, machine readable record of every audit or reconciliation finding raised across the fleet:
its severity, the audit or reconciliation doc it came from, and whether it is still open, fixed, or
accepted as wontfix. Exists so a finding raised in one session cannot quietly vanish by the next one,
and so any future audit or "PR done" step can reconcile against what is still open instead of
re-discovering (or re-forgetting) the same gap.

Extends regression-ledger (REGRESSION-LEDGER.md, same skill, same GitHub Contents API write plus
independent reread verify pattern), kept as a separate file because a finding's status changes over
time (open, then fixed or wontfix), unlike a regression entry, which is an immutable historical
record once written.

**Before reporting an audit clean or a PR done, run `node ledger.mjs finding check`** (optionally
scoped to a finding id or a source audit doc substring). Any open critical or high severity finding
means the work is not actually done yet, say so plainly rather than reporting it clean. File a new
finding with `node ledger.mjs finding add`, close one with
`node ledger.mjs finding close <id> --status fixed|wontfix`.

### finding:FND-20260724-e673 severity:high status:fixed | gateway.sh xero-request never wired the dry_run flag into the ARGS JSON sent to the gateway tool - every 'live' mode call silently ran as a no-op dry run regardless of the mode argument, with a misleading 'LIVE WRITE' stderr message printed anyway

- **Source audit doc:** OTCHealth Gateway (CFO) skill, gateway.sh xero-request dispatcher
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Hyperagent CFO seat 2026-07-23: caught live while executing a Matt-approved BankTransaction coding (item 14, GS Capital 300K equity entry) - first live-mode call returned body:null + error:dry_run despite passing live. Read gateway.sh source, found DRYRUN variable computed but never included in the python-built ARGS dict. Fixed by threading DRYRUN through as an explicit arg and adding dry_run to the JSON payload. Re-ran the identical command post-fix: HTTP 200, LineItems populated as expected, independently re-confirmed via a separate xero-get call. Skill update proposed via UpdateSkillAndScripts (draft SKILLCONFIG_4Y5dof5U, awaiting Matt's card confirmation).

### finding:FND-20260724-68f5 severity:medium status:fixed | Gateway truncates Xero API error response bodies to a fixed short length before returning them, making real ValidationException detail unreadable by the calling agent - blocked a live attempt to create a new Xero chart-of-accounts entry (Code 6573, Stock Based Compensation Expense) for InnerScope; 5 varied payloads all failed identically with the message cut off right before the actual error text

- **Fix commit:** otchealth-mcp-server#260 squash dd2691b4 (residual raw-fallback cap; the Elements[].ValidationErrors extraction itself was fixed earlier in #153), deployed gateway rev 25
- **Verified by:** extractXeroErrorDetail bound raised 2000->16KB uniformly + new preserve-Elements-verbatim tier; builder repro proved a needle at ~index 2128 survives new code and is provably lost under old cap; end-to-end xeroRequest test with a realistic long ValidationException green.

### finding:FND-20260724-cd01 severity:critical status:fixed | Xero rejects ANY ManualJournal write (new post or void) that references an ARCHIVED account - blocked voiding QBO-JE-18471, leaving InnerScope's HA Investment-in-Subsidiary DOUBLE-COUNTED at 31,758,284 (both the old 15,879,142 lump entry on archived acct 1808 and the new 15,879,142 detail on active acct 1740 are simultaneously live) as of this finding. Confirmed via controlled A/B test: identical 1 dollar journal succeeds against active account 1740, fails identically against archived account 1808. Also confirms this is a DIFFERENT root cause than the earlier accounting.settings scope finding (FND-20260724-68f5) - this fails even though ManualJournals writes are otherwise fully working (14 other new journals posted successfully same session).

- **Source audit doc:** FY2021 Completion Punch List Item 11 (HA acquisition) - live posting session 2026-07-23/24
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** RESOLVED 2026-07-24 by the CFO seat once the CTO's PR #153 error-truncation fix surfaced Xero's real error text. Root cause was NOT the archived-account restriction being absolute - it was payload shape: un-archiving requires POST /Accounts/{id} with a body containing ONLY {Status:ACTIVE} (Xero refuses details+status together, verbatim: 'Cannot update account details and STATUS on the same request'). Sequence, each step independently re-fetched and confirmed: un-archived acct 1808 (ACTIVE), VOIDED lump entry QBO-JE-18471 309f6186 ($15,879,142, Status=VOIDED), re-archived 1808. VERIFIED at 12/31/2021: acct 1808 absent from the TB entirely; acct 1740 = exactly $15,879,142. The $31,758,284 double-count is eliminated. (Current-date TB shows 1808 credit / 1740 debit netting to zero - that is the correct pre-existing 2025 ATRA transfer to OTCHealth, not a residual bug.)

### finding:FND-20260724-f6df severity:high status:fixed | Xero attachment uploads via the gateway's xero_request tool do not actually persist, despite returning a seemingly-successful response with a real-looking AttachmentID for small payloads. Confirmed via independent read (xero_attachments) after every attempt: zero attachments actually exist on the target journals, at ANY size tried (70 bytes, 500KB, 2MB, 7.8MB all show empty on readback; 2MB+ additionally returns an explicit Xero-side HTTP 500, 7.8MB returns a gateway internal_error before even reaching Xero).

- **Source audit doc:** Matt's 2026-07-24 directive to attach APA/SPA agreements and work papers to Xero transactions
- **Fix commit:** otchealth-mcp-server#259 squash ffd2d88736c1357a783a0abb2201399d7e9c0b6d (residual half; the dedicated xero_attachment_upload raw-bytes fix landed earlier under this same ID)
- **Verified by:** CTO diff review: xero_request now refuses POST/PUT to any Attachments path (error use_xero_attachment_upload) BEFORE any network call, incl. under dry_run; DELETE ungated (no body). Builder counterfactual: guard disabled -> tests fail with attempted live write. write-guard 37/37, tools 32/32, typecheck+build+CI green. Deploys to prod with gateway rev 25

### finding:FND-20260724-b55e severity:high status:wontfix | The gateway's Xero OAuth connection (cfo lane) is missing the accounting.settings WRITE scope: it has accounting.transactions + accounting.settings.read but not accounting.settings. This blocks ALL Xero chart-of-accounts / organisation-settings writes - confirmed on POST /Accounts (create new account, e.g. 6573 Stock Based Comp) and POST /Accounts/{id} (un-archive account 1808). This is the ROOT CAUSE that makes the HA double-count unfixable via API: the only API path to remove the old lump entry QBO-JE-18471 is un-archive 1808 -> void the journal -> re-archive, and the un-archive step needs this scope. Transaction writes (BankTransactions, ManualJournals, Invoices, Contacts, etc.) are unaffected and work fine.

- **Source audit doc:** OTCHealth Gateway / Xero OAuth app - cfo lane scope configuration (diagnosed 2026-07-24)
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** CLOSED AS INVALID 2026-07-24 - this finding's premise was WRONG and no scope change is needed. I concluded the cfo-lane Xero app was missing the accounting.settings write scope, inferring it from a generic ValidationException whose real text was being truncated. The CTO disproved it by reading the live Cosmos-cached Xero token for org innd and decoding its JWT scope claim: accounting.settings IS present. Correctly declined to run a needless re-consent. The ACTUAL root causes were mine: (1) Xero creates accounts with PUT /Accounts, not POST (POST = update, hence 'Account is not found') - proven by creating acct 6573 via PUT, HTTP 200; (2) un-archiving requires a Status-only body. Both now fixed and used to resolve FND-20260724-cd01. Lesson recorded: do not infer a permissions root cause from a truncated error - get the real error text first.

### finding:FND-20260727-f01a severity:high status:fixed | Xero ManualJournals VOIDED-status write: HTTP 400 error response ('status VOIDED cannot be applied to the document') does NOT reliably indicate the void failed -- it can succeed silently on the backend regardless of response code. Reproduced on HA journal 2c360c58 (errored, but was already VOIDED on re-fetch), causing an unintended double-reversal via a redundant manual reversal journal (d0c26934) before being caught and fully corrected same session.

- **Source audit doc:** Hyperagent Master Plan doc cms2h3plu295z06aduy6ku65y (HA + INND FY2021 Closeout — Master Plan), Section 2
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Independently re-fetched 2c360c58 by ID after its 'error' response and found Status=VOIDED already applied -- the error was misleading, not a failure. This caused a genuine double-reversal (posted reversal d0c26934 on top of an already-voided original). Diagnosed via account-level Trial Balance exact-match proof, not just aggregate coincidence (Canon Financial Services acct 2301: measured effect exactly 2.0000x expected). Voided d0c26934 (this time the response cleanly confirmed VOIDED); independently re-fetched by ID (confirmed) and cross-checked both account-level (2301 exact to $266,965.40) and aggregate Balance Sheet (Assets $14,453,476.26 / Liabilities $18,633,684.47 / Equity $(4,180,208.21)) -- exact penny match to pre-incident baseline on all 3 totals. Adopted protocol going forward: always independently re-fetch the specific object by ID after ANY Xero write regardless of response code; verify at account-level Trial Balance, never aggregate reports alone; prefer offsetting reversal entries over void/delete for corrections.

AWARE now builds under the 2026-08 exercise-program release contract with no such control plane. Nothing to fix; closing so the three highs stop implying live risk.

Forged-order quarantine path proven with a genuine Shopify 404 (exec 2733, not the earlier undefined-URL false-positive). Duplicate replay proven to send zero second emails, row updatedAt unchanged (exec 2735).

Separately, conversation 215475357819316 (the long-open real customer escalation) is NOT returned by /conversations/search under ANY tested filter including since=creation-60s and since=0, despite total_count reporting 109 on the broad query while data array returned empty. Direct GET by conversation ID always works correctly and was the only reason 215475357819316's status stayed accurately tracked. Daily digest 24h-window search-based monitoring cannot be trusted alone to catch new safety escalations same-day; recommend switching primary detection to the tag-based webhook/Safety Monitor n8n workflow D8NH3ITNIhvPyjfP path (already tags in real time) plus a periodic direct-GET reconciliation against known IDs, rather than relying on conversations/search for discovery.

Root cause is the SAME dead Azure Foundry already named in claude-tools CLAUDE.md (enrich.mjs + deep-pass.mjs called out by name): a live authenticated probe using the actual current production key returns HTTP 401 'invalid subscription key' on both otchealth-foundry.openai.azure.com and the .cognitiveservices.azure.com fallback host. deep-pass.mjs is NOT one of the six skills tracked under FND-20260819-c9bb -- this is a seventh, previously-undocumented dark caller. Fixing the cron alone (without a processor decision) would be ACTIVELY HARMFUL, not merely inert: deep-pass.mjs's chat()-failure catch path sets deep:true + review:NEEDS_CLAUDE_REVIEW/'summary model error' on every row it touches and that state is terminal (selectTodo's !r.deep filter never re-selects it), so one 90-min tick would flood all 3 privileged rooms' _REVIEW/review-queue.csv (the CFO/CLO 'job one' list) with near-total false-positive review flags on the first run. Recommendation: hold the cron at its current placeholder (do not apply rate(90 minutes) yet) until Matt picks a replacement processor for deep-pass.mjs (mirrors the enrich.mjs -> OpenAI-direct port, or route via the AWS Bedrock-for-privileged-rooms option already proposed in otchealth-cto/CLAUDE.md's 2026-08-19 entry) -- deep-pass.mjs sends full document TEXT plus page-image VISION calls for finance-cfo-source-docs/legal-company/legal-personal, so this is the same class of reserved processor decision as enrich.mjs's, not an infra-parity fix.

- **Verified by:** LIVE on prod rev 25: shield_check returns configured:false + provider 'none (azure retired)' + summary 'Prompt Shields: NOT RUN ... This is not a scan verdict.' The root defect (a dead/unconfigured provider rendering as clean/fully-grounded = fake pass) is closed by design: CONTENT_SAFETY_RETIRED is env-independent so no stale task-def value can re-dial the dead host; counterfactual tests assert fetch is never called even with env set + an attack-indicating stub. Replacement provider (Bedrock Guardrails) is a separate future decision

Rationale: the NonProd account already runs real daily traffic behind CloudFront dhpdikcla0tbg with RDS 7-day backups + deletion protection, GitHub OIDC two-role trust, and a proven deploy pipeline; a promotion would be a data+DNS migration with zero functional gain and real cutover risk.

### finding:FND-20260830-6a1a severity:medium status:fixed | daily-digest nightly.sh still hardcodes --azure for the commons room STORAGE backend and fails every night with 'blob put 403 AccountIsDisabled' on the dead otchealthcommons account, after generating the digest; sibling librarian.sh was migrated to S3 on 2026-08-18 but this script's header never was. Fix needs the same per-room S3-mirror verification librarian.sh's audit did.

- **Verified by:** Fix landed on main BEFORE this dispatch began (commit 7a308e0, PR #508, 2026-09-01, same CTO session lineage) -- the ledger entry was just never closed, which is very likely why this exact bug got re-dispatched to a subagent a day later. Independently re-verified rather than trusting the commit message: (1) read the full current nightly.sh -- zero live --azure/--key-secret flags remain, only header prose describing the historical bug; (2) confirmed otchealthcommons/company-journal has a real row in skills/kb-memory/s3-blob.mjs's MIRROR table (bucket otchealth-brain-dr-55c84f6b), matching job/librarian.sh's proven per-room S3 pattern the original finding asked for; (3) sh -n clean on nightly.sh. Added the regression lock nightly.sh itself never had: tests/nightly-sh-storage-backend.test.mjs, proven failing-first against the pre-fix commit (5/7 assertions failed with the exact --azure text) and passing 7/7 against current content -- see claude-tools PR #517 (draft, not yet merged).

Budgets set from live measurement against real production prompt shapes (repeated, because spend is non-deterministic: 339-1657 tokens on identical input), not trivial probes. Two CTO-verified critic findings fixed before merge: same-budget retry in the shared fetchOpenAIWithFlexRetry (was throwing on the first truncation while flexRetryPolicy had granted 6 attempts), and selfrepair re-typing a hand-rolled Number(env)>0 budget guard instead of the shared positiveIntEnv (0.7 sent a fractional budget; Infinity serialized to null, dropping max_completion_tokens entirely). Fail-on-old-code proof for both. Toolkit gate 2124 pass.

- **Source audit doc:** session 2026-09-02 CTO verification of the Datadog monitor-estate audit
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Verified firsthand, not taken from the subagent report. (1) Datadog /api/v1/query for sum:otc.fleet.ledger_flush{*}.as_count() over the last 3d returns status=ok with ZERO series, despite this session writing multiple ledger entries -- so the silence is real, not an idle-fleet artifact. (2) KB_DD_EMIT is UNSET in this session's shells; mem.mjs emitFleet() only emits when it is 1. (3) ~/.designer/credentials.env DOES contain KB_DD_EMIT=1 at line 4 but its mtime is 2026-08-19 06:25. session-start.sh truncates that file before rewriting it (( umask 077; : > $CRED )), so it is rewritten in full on every run -- a 14-day-old mtime proves the hydration block has not executed in THIS SANDBOX since 2026-08-19. Scope caution: verified for this sandbox only; other seats may differ. (4) The frozen file holds 13 dead AZURE_* keys (dead sub 55c84f6b, dead vault kv-otc-55c84f6bef, dead Foundry/Speech) plus N8N_BASE_URL=https://automation.otchealth.app, the dead host fleet doctrine explicitly forbids. (5) skills/designer/scripts/_lib.mjs reads this file as a fallback after process.env, so the creative skill can resolve dead Azure endpoints from it. (6) session-start.sh line 288 still hardcodes KEYVAULT default to the dead kv-otc-55c84f6bef, and line 326 calls fetch-secrets-azure.mjs with 2>/dev/null || true, discarding both stderr and exit code. NOT YET VERIFIED: whether session-start.sh fails vs is skipped in this environment, and whether the designer skill actually breaks in practice. Consequence: Datadog monitors 22895854 (ledger SILENT) and 23035302 (routed agent activity abnormal) have been blind, reading No Data as if healthy.

- **Fix commit:** e35fea4
- **Verified by:** Second occurrence within ~1h. ea38477 (+6/-259) reverted PR #141 again; its real change was three curl lines losing --resolve. Authored 04:33 UTC, ONE MINUTE after the guard merged at 04:32, from a base predating the first restore. THE GUARD WORKED: check went RED on ea38477 (verified via check-runs on that commit), which is detection succeeding, not prevention failing -- a check cannot block a direct push. PREVENTION now in place: branch protection on otchealth-cto main with required_status_checks.strict=true (up-to-date-before-merge, the structural anti-stale-base fix), required context [check], 0 required approvals so authors can still self-merge, enforce_admins=false for emergency bypass, no force-push, no deletion. Verified by GET .../branches/main/protection. Restored via PR #143 by reverse-patch-minus-their-hunks; diff vs b31f66b8 shows ONLY their three --resolve removals. Note workflow_dispatch runs from any branch, so a push-then-dispatch debug loop never required main.

- **Source audit doc:** session 2026-09-02 Datadog AWS integration enablement
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Confirmed the gap firsthand: GET /api/v2/integration/aws/accounts returned data:[] (zero accounts), so Datadog could see no CloudWatch metric anywhere in the estate -- all prior 'healthy' monitors were synthetics, custom app metrics, or one APM tracer. Registered account 900915535335 via POST /api/v2/integration/aws/accounts (role DatadogIntegrationRole, include_all regions), created the IAM role with trust to arn:aws:iam::464622532012:root gated on the Datadog-issued sts:ExternalId. THE PRINCIPAL WAS NOT GUESSED: docs render it per-site via JS and search would not yield it, so I took it from Datadog's own public CloudFormation template (datadog-cloudformation-template.s3.amazonaws.com/aws/main.yaml), which hardcodes 464622532012 as 'Datadog AWS account ID allowed to assume the integration IAM role. DO NOT CHANGE!' and has NO per-site mapping -- verified by grepping the raw file, where it is the only 12-digit id present. This disproved the assumption that us3 needs a different id. Permissions are a 39-action inline read-only policy scoped to the audit's named gaps (ECS/RDS/OpenSearch/EventBridge/Scheduler/Lambda/CloudWatch/ELB/CloudFront), deliberately NOT the managed ReadOnlyAccess policy which would grant S3 object reads and Secrets Manager metadata; verified programmatically that zero granted actions are non-read. PENDING: first aws.* datapoint not yet observed (polling); role creation + account registration are two API successes that do NOT by themselves prove Datadog can assume the role.

### finding:FND-20260902-7cd1 severity:medium status:fixed | gh-app.mjs request truncates responses at exactly 64KB with no error, silently corrupting any list/count taken through it

- **Source audit doc:** session 2026-09-02 fleet PR recount
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Reproduced: GET /repos/InnerScopeHearing/flatstick/pulls?state=open&per_page=100 returns EXACTLY 65536 bytes and yields one parseable PR (number 267), while /search/issues total_count for the same query reports 8. A single PR with a large body fills the buffer, so grep/JSON.parse over the result reports 1 instead of 8 -- and JSON.parse fails outright with 'Unterminated string', which is at least loud, whereas grep-based counting fails SILENTLY and looks like a legitimate small number. I took three wrong fleet-wide PR counts through this path before the exact-65536 byte count gave it away. Impact: any agent using gh-app.mjs request for a list endpoint on a repo with verbose PR/issue bodies gets a truncated answer with no indication. Workarounds that work today: use /search/issues?q=...&per_page=1 and read total_count, or request narrower fields/pages. Real fix: have request either stream/paginate or FAIL LOUD on truncation rather than returning a valid-looking prefix. Same silent-success class as the eval-runner and fleet-medic incidents.

- **Source audit doc:** session 2026-09-02 gh-app stdout drain fix
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** My earlier finding FND-20260902-7cd1 said gh-app.mjs 'truncates responses at exactly 64KB', implying a cap in the tool. THAT WAS WRONG and is corrected here rather than restated. Disproof: the same request redirected to a FILE yields 306506 bytes and all 8 PRs, while piped it yields exactly 65536 and 1 PR; and a plain 200KB pipe in the same shell passes unharmed, so it is not a general pipe cap either. REAL CAUSE: on POSIX Node's stdout is synchronous to a file/TTY but ASYNCHRONOUS to a pipe, and process.exit() does not wait for the pending write. Every command did console.log(big); process.exit(n). FIX: set process.exitCode and let the process end naturally (branch claude/gh-app-stdout-drain). Verified piped 65536->306506 bytes, PR count 1->8, exit status preserved (0 success / 1 on 404). Regression test first proves the failure mode is real on this runtime with a scratch script (so it cannot become vacuous), then pins gh-app.mjs; counterfactual fails against the unfixed file. GENERAL LESSON worth more than the fix: never call process.exit() on a path that has written to stdout.

### finding:FND-20260903-9a96 severity:high status:fixed | CORRECTION + residual risk to FND-20260903-ba85: the flex/router failure is per-model CAPACITY (OpenAI 429 'Flex does not have sufficient resources... change service_tier=default'), not a capability limit. Proven live: gpt-5.6-luna+flex=429, gpt-5.6-terra+flex=200, gpt-5.6-sol+flex=200. fetch-budget.ts treats 429 as retryable and re-sends the IDENTICAL flex request, so the retry is structurally futile and surfaces as a hang. The rev-43 guard (tier!=router) is a PROXY for the real condition: flex capacity is dynamic and per-model, so if terra's pool runs dry the same futile-retry chain hits the STANDARD tier (default for nearly every fleet llm_azure call, user-blocking included) and the guard does nothing. Durable fix: on a flex-specific 429, retry once WITHOUT service_tier.

- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Fixed by otchealth-mcp-server #284 (squash 2f8a7ea6). On a flex-capacity 429 the gateway now retries ONCE without service_tier, the remedy OpenAI's own error text names, instead of letting fetch-budget re-send the identical flex request (which can only 429 again). Double-gated: the failing request must actually have carried service_tier flex AND the 429 text must contain both a flex keyword and a capacity keyword, so an ordinary rate-limit or quota 429 is untouched. Cost stays honest because requestedServiceTier resets after a successful fallback, so a call served at default can never claim the 50 percent flex discount through the echo-wins resolution. Worst case 4 physical attempts (2 legs x fetch-budget's own retry), not a multiplied ladder. CTO-verified from the seat: read the diff line by line; confirmed postToTarget puts OpenAI's error.message into FoundryError unmodified so detection fires on the real path; ran the exported predicate against the exact live 429 string captured earlier plus rate-limit, quota, non-429 and empty-message negatives, all correct; 14/14 targeted tests pass; typecheck clean; counterfactual 10 of 11 fail with the implementation reverted and the file restored byte-identical; CI green. NOTE the residual is now closed at the mechanism level, not merely proxied by the tier !== router guard, which remains as a cheap optimization.

Root cause named in the fix: STORAGE_BACKEND already defaulted to the live s3, so the AWS default-flip (#466) moved storage and missed search; the new test skills/doc-indexer/tests/search-backend-default.test.mjs pins BOTH defaults as symmetric so a future flip cannot miss one again. azure remains an accepted VALUE with its branch untouched; only the default moved, plus the help text and header comment that advertised it as default. CTO-verified credential-free by reproducing CI's environment with env -u for every AWS variable: 5/5 pass, counterfactual with enrich.mjs reverted fails 3 of 5 (the 2 that stay green assert invariants unrelated to the default and were reported as such, not claimed as flipping), full run-tests.sh ALL GREEN across 230 targets, all 8 CI checks green including CodeQL and the auto critic. Tests are deliberately credential-free and do NOT claim to observe the resolved BACKEND constant, because the only subprocess path that echoes it calls resolveStorage() first and would have reproduced the same non-hermetic defect that held #553 the same day.

### finding:FND-20260903-9f95 severity:medium status:fixed | The gateway, the fleet's keystone service, has had NO in-container Datadog telemetry for at least 14 days. Live Datadog queries: container.cpu.usage{service:gateway-mcp} and trace.express.request.hits{service:gateway-mcp} both return NO DATA over a 14-day window, and otc.fleet.ledger_flush has exactly 1 point (2026-09-02 06:00Z). The ONLY gateway visibility in Datadog is aws.ecs.service.running, which comes from the AWS integration polling CloudWatch, not from inside the container (35 points, current). So APM traces and in-container metrics are dark and any monitor keyed on application metrics for service:gateway-mcp is blind. IMPORTANT: this is NOT caused by today's Graviton/ARM64 migration; the 14-day window predates it, and I checked specifically because the ARM cutover looked like the obvious culprit. Today's change did ADD a new obstacle though: the image embeds Datadog serverless-init, which logs 'serverless-init is running on an unsupported architecture (arm64). Monitoring may behave unexpectedly.' at every container start on rev 43/44, so the standard serverless-init fix path will not work while the gateway stays on Graviton. Resolving this is a design decision with a cost tradeoff: revert to amd64 and lose about 20 percent compute savings, or move emission off serverless-init to a path that supports arm64 (Datadog Agent sidecar, or OTLP export). Not urgent (broken 14+ days, no outage, liveness still covered by ECS metrics, /health and the eval job) but it should not stay invisible.

- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** RETRACTED AS OVERSTATED, by my own follow-up check. The claim 'the gateway has had NO in-container Datadog telemetry for at least 14 days' is WRONG. Root cause of my error: I queried invented metric names (otc.fleet.openai.cost_usd, .calls) instead of listing the real ones, so genuine data read as NO DATA. The actual catalog is otc.fleet.openai.cost_usd_est / .requests / .tokens plus otc.gateway.llm.prompt_tokens / .cached_tokens / .cached_pct, and ALL of them are flowing and current (each last point 2026-09-03 17:00Z; over 72h: cost_usd_est 28 pts sum 1.0223, requests 28 pts sum 145.8, tokens 27 pts sum 109734). So the gateway's own direct-POST custom metrics, including the OpenAI cost visibility from mcp-server #273, are HEALTHY. Superseded by FND-20260903-a7c1, which states the genuine and much narrower gap.

### finding:FND-20260903-a7c1 severity:low status:open | Gateway APM traces and container resource metrics are absent from Datadog, though the app's own custom metrics are healthy. Verified live 2026-09-03: trace.express.request.hits{service:gateway-mcp} and container.cpu.usage{service:gateway-mcp} both NO DATA over 14 days, while otc.fleet.openai.cost_usd_est/.requests/.tokens and otc.gateway.llm.* are all current to 17:00Z. So the direct-POST custom-metric path works and only the serverless-init-provided layer (APM + container resource) is dark. DD_API_KEY and DD_METRICS_API_KEY are both present as task-def secrets and serverless-init is the image entrypoint, so this is not a missing credential. On rev 43/44 serverless-init also logs 'running on an unsupported architecture (arm64). Monitoring may behave unexpectedly.' at every container start, which is consistent, BUT note the traces were already absent while the gateway was still amd64, so arm64 is not the original cause and reverting architecture would probably not fix it. LOW severity: liveness is covered by aws.ecs.service.running (from the AWS integration, current), the /health endpoint, and the eval job, and cost visibility (the reason the telemetry exists) is working. Fixing it means either a Datadog Agent sidecar or OTLP export, both arm64-capable; do NOT give back the roughly 20 percent Graviton saving for this. CORRECTS AND SUPERSEDES FND-20260903-9f95, which overstated the gap because I queried invented metric names instead of listing the catalog.

### finding:FND-20260903-2d71 severity:medium status:open | 110 zero-byte source documents in the CFO and company-legal data rooms, surfaced by the first scheduled OCR sweep. Measured live 2026-09-03 by listing object SIZES: cfo/cfo-source-docs 49 of 19,053 (0.26%), legal/company 61 of 5,557 (1.10%). These are real files with real names occupying real keys that contain zero bytes, so every consumer sees a document that exists and has no content. NOT an OCR bug and NOT caused by the sweep: Textract's BadDocumentException 'The document is empty' is literally correct. Full reconciliation of the run's 77 failures: 75 zero-byte (33 cfo + 42 legal/company) plus exactly 2 genuine format refusals that match the 2 non-BadDocument errors one-for-one (a 12.5MB coupletalking.jpeg hit IMAGE_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED; a 2.19MB signed LOI/SPA PDF hit INVALID_IMAGE_TYPE). ZERO failures came from legal/personal, so the attorney-privileged room is unaffected and was never enumerated. WHY IT MATTERS: the visible cluster is INND FinanceTeam bank statements for accounts 4524/6532/6877, where the FY2021 monthly PDFs are empty while the FY2022 file sitting beside them is 30,873 bytes and OCR'd fine -- that is source evidence the CFO's FY2021-present reconstruction would silently lack, and INND financials are MNPI. Most of the 110 carry no year token in the path so the true period spread is wider than the 13 path-dated 2021 files. NEXT: this is a data-recovery question for the CFO/CLO (re-fetch from OneDrive/SharePoint originals or the pre-migration source), not a code fix; the sweep will keep reporting them as failures every run until the bytes exist, which is correct fail-loud behavior and should not be suppressed.

### finding:FND-20260904-4b1e severity:medium status:open | The gateway's /register endpoint logs ONLY on success, so every rejection is invisible. Live cost, 2026-09-04: the operator's ChatGPT desktop app (Codex MCP client) failed to connect and CloudWatch showed no oauth_register line at all, which read as 'the client never reached us' and sent diagnosis down the wrong path. The client HAD reached us and been refused 400 invalid_redirect_uri; that return sits above the logger.info call, so it emits nothing. This is the fleet's recurring silent-failure shape applied to an auth endpoint, and it is worse here because a rejection is exactly the event an operator needs to see. FIX: log every /register rejection at warn with the reason code and the offending field (the redirect_uri is caller-supplied and not a secret), so a failed connect is a log read rather than an investigation. Found while fixing FND-20260904-7c2a.

### finding:FND-20260904-9d33 severity:low status:open | The gateway's unauthenticated 401 body names an internal environment variable. Any anonymous caller to POST /mcp gets a message telling them to provide a bearer token and naming the specific env var the gateway reads it from. No secret VALUE leaks, but the name of an internal credential binding should not be in a public error string: it tells an unauthenticated stranger which integration exists and what the credential is called. FIX: return a generic 'missing or invalid bearer token' with the WWW-Authenticate challenge (which is correct and must stay) and drop the variable name. Observed live 2026-09-04 while diagnosing FND-20260904-7c2a.

### finding:FND-20260904-2f80 severity:low status:fixed | A self-referential node_modules SYMLINK was committed into otchealth-mcp-server and broke test runs from the primary checkout. The repo's .gitignore lists 'node_modules/' WITH a trailing slash, which matches a directory but NOT a symlink named node_modules, so the symlink slipped past the ignore rule and was committed on 2026-09-03. It points at its own absolute path, so any resolution fails with ELOOP and every npm/node test invocation from that checkout dies. It was removed from main incidentally by PR #286 (the loopback fix) because that branch's worktree had the stray link deleted before staging. FIX: add a slashless 'node_modules' entry to .gitignore so both forms are ignored, and consider a CI guard rejecting any committed symlink that points inside the repo. Worth noting the near-miss: PR #287's branch predates the removal and still carried the link, so a careless merge could have reinstated it.

- **Fix commit:** ff929c1c8e38a77e16b00fcdd15199f640896d5e
- **Verified by:** otchealth-mcp-server#287 (squash ff929c1) adds the slashless 'node_modules' .gitignore entry alongside the existing 'node_modules/' one, and explicitly git-rm'd the tracked self-referential symlink the branch still carried (blob 6c68b87, commit 3e6a26f on the branch) rather than relying on 3-way merge semantics; verified post-merge that git ls-tree origin/main node_modules is empty. NOT built: the suggested CI guard rejecting committed intra-repo symlinks; the ignore rule closes the slip path, the guard remains an optional hardening.

### finding:FND-20260904-d26b severity:high status:fixed | Gateway consent interstitial: pending-auth TTL 10 min is shorter than the 30 min setup-code TTL, and the 'expired' dead-end page does not tell the user a NEW page is required; users re-submit fresh codes into a spent page.

Proven code-free against mcp.otchealth.app: consent page now renders 'This page is valid for about 29 more minutes, until HH:MM UTC.' (30-min window derived from setup-codes DEFAULT_TTL_MINUTES, was 10); a wrong code re-renders with the validity line intact; a spent/unknown pending id returns the new dead-end copy 'click Authenticate again, and enter your setup code on the new page that opens. A code will not work on this page.' with no form; full elevate path (fresh cto code -> 302 -> auth code -> token -> 202 tools incl. privileged) passes.
