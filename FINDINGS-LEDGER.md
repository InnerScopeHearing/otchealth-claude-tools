# Findings Ledger

Durable, machine readable record of every audit or reconciliation finding raised across the fleet:
its severity, the audit or reconciliation doc it came from, and whether it is still open, fixed, or
accepted as wontfix. Exists so a finding raised in one session cannot quietly vanish by the next one,
and so any future audit or "PR done" step can reconcile against what is still open instead of
re-discovering (or re-forgetting) the same gap.

Extends regression-ledger (REGRESSION-LEDGER.md, same skill, same GitHub Contents API write plus
independent reread verify pattern), kept as a separate file because a finding's status changes over
time (open, then fixed or wontfix), unlike a regression entry, which is an immutable historical
record once written.

**Before reporting an audit clean or a PR done, run `node ledger.mjs finding check`** (optionally
scoped to a finding id or a source audit doc substring). Any open critical or high severity finding
means the work is not actually done yet, say so plainly rather than reporting it clean. File a new
finding with `node ledger.mjs finding add`, close one with
`node ledger.mjs finding close <id> --status fixed|wontfix`.

### finding:FND-20260724-29c0 severity:high status:fixed | Posting-gate mapping false negatives: 3 of 5 'Ready' FY2021 posting items (iHEAR note, iHEAR Series C, HA 8-row acquisition batch, ~17.5M combined) were already posted in undifferentiated lump form under generic QBO-JE-XXXXX narrations; original search only checked top-level Narration text, missing JournalLine.Description where the real content lives. Caught before any Xero write executed.

Both tracking tables and the Master punch list corrected same-day before any posting occurred.

### finding:FND-20260724-e673 severity:high status:fixed | gateway.sh xero-request never wired the dry_run flag into the ARGS JSON sent to the gateway tool - every 'live' mode call silently ran as a no-op dry run regardless of the mode argument, with a misleading 'LIVE WRITE' stderr message printed anyway

- **Source audit doc:** OTCHealth Gateway (CFO) skill, gateway.sh xero-request dispatcher
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Hyperagent CFO seat 2026-07-23: caught live while executing a Matt-approved BankTransaction coding (item 14, GS Capital 300K equity entry) - first live-mode call returned body:null + error:dry_run despite passing live. Read gateway.sh source, found DRYRUN variable computed but never included in the python-built ARGS dict. Fixed by threading DRYRUN through as an explicit arg and adding dry_run to the JSON payload. Re-ran the identical command post-fix: HTTP 200, LineItems populated as expected, independently re-confirmed via a separate xero-get call. Skill update proposed via UpdateSkillAndScripts (draft SKILLCONFIG_4Y5dof5U, awaiting Matt's card confirmation).

### finding:FND-20260724-68f5 severity:medium status:open | Gateway truncates Xero API error response bodies to a fixed short length before returning them, making real ValidationException detail unreadable by the calling agent - blocked a live attempt to create a new Xero chart-of-accounts entry (Code 6573, Stock Based Compensation Expense) for InnerScope; 5 varied payloads all failed identically with the message cut off right before the actual error text

- **Source audit doc:** OTCHealth Gateway (CFO) skill / otchealth-mcp-gateway server, xero_request tool error handling
- **Fix commit:** (none yet)
- **Verified by:** Hyperagent CFO seat 2026-07-23: reproduced 5x with varying Code/Name/TaxType, confirmed truncation point shifts predictably with payload size (ruling out a fixed-field-name cutoff and confirming a fixed character-count truncation), confirmed the truncation happens server-side (gateway_call_full.py has no local truncation logic - the raw text field itself arrives pre-truncated from the gateway), attempted Sentry as an alternate diagnostic path but the MCP grant is not authorized for this seat. No account was created - all 5 attempts were rejected by Xero before persisting, books unaffected. Needs CTO-side investigation: either the gateway server's error-wrapping code (likely a response_body[:N] slice) or the underlying Xero validation cause itself (possibly a chart-of-accounts count cap or an OAuth scope gap specific to Accounts vs. transaction writes).
