// Wiring gate for signal-radar's pg-state (RDS Postgres) agent-state backend
// (skills/kb-memory/pg-state.mjs), which sat built-but-unconnected since PR #437 (2026-08-16) until
// 2026-09-03. This is the file that caught the LIVE production incident: radar.mjs's own `--emit` path
// ran every 30 minutes, exited 0 every time, and printed "cosmos NOT configured ... nothing persisted
// or dispatched" -- a scheduled job that looked perfectly healthy (fresh CloudWatch logs, RunTask
// succeeding, every detector printing [ok]) while silently doing nothing since at least the
// 2026-08-28 SSM cleanup that removed the dead cosmos-endpoint secret. Two things pinned here, with a
// fake backend so nothing here ever touches a real Postgres connection or needs AWS credentials:
//
//   1. common.mjs's cosmosConfig/cosmosPutSignal/cosmosQuerySignals really delegate to whatever
//      backend is currently swapped in (container "signals", partitioned by owner).
//   2. radar.mjs's runScan() -- the scheduled job's ONLY entrypoint (job/radar.sh runs exactly
//      `node radar.mjs scan --emit`) -- actually persists and dispatches a firing signal when the
//      backend reports configured, and FAILS LOUD (a non-zero exit code) rather than silently
//      succeeding when it does not, or when persistence fails outright once "configured".
//
// Every test that exercises a fail-loud path saves + restores process.exitCode around itself:
// process.exitCode is a process-global, and leaving it at 1 would poison node --test's own final exit
// code for the WHOLE run (every other test file included), not just this one assertion.
