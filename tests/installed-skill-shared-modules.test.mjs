// Skills that import shared helpers as "../../setup/<mod>.mjs" must still resolve once installed
// into ~/.claude/skills, which means the installers have to place those modules at ~/.claude/setup.
//
// THE FAILURE THIS PINS (2026-09-06). skills/ and setup/ are siblings in the git tree, so
// `import { awsFetch } from "../../setup/aws-sigv4.mjs"` resolves fine from a clone. Both installers
// copied ONLY skills/, so at the installed path the same import resolved to ~/.claude/setup/... ,
// which did not exist. Thirteen skills across twenty files died with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND when
// invoked from ~/.claude/skills, INCLUDING kb-memory (the fleet working-memory ledger) and
// company-brain.
//
// It stayed invisible for the worst possible reason: the same code worked perfectly when run from
// the /tmp/octools clone, which is how the ECS jobs and every explicitly-pathed call reach it. Only
// the installed path was dark, and the one signal it produced was a SessionStart hook line reading
// "kb-memory unavailable this session" -- which looks exactly like a benign transient.
//
// The check matches the DESTINATION, not merely the presence of a copy command. An installer that
// copied setup/*.mjs somewhere else would satisfy a source-only assertion while every import still
// failed, so the assertion is on the ~/.claude/setup path the runtime actually resolves to.

// HOW DEPENDENCIES ARE FOUND, and why it is not a pile of regexes.
//
// Three rounds of review on this file each found another import form the pattern list had missed:
// dynamic import and re-exports, then side-effect-only `import "x.mjs"`, then block-comment trivia,
// and a line-comment variant after that. Every one was a real, valid form. The lesson was not "add
// another alternation" -- it was that pattern-matching JavaScript syntax has no natural stopping
// point, and each round shipped a slightly-less-wrong claim of completeness.
//
// So STATIC imports are now parsed by V8 itself. `vm.SourceTextModule` compiles the source and
// exposes `dependencySpecifiers`, the exact list of static specifiers, without executing anything.
// That covers every static form -- `import x from`, bare `import "x"`, `export ... from`, and any
// comment or whitespace trivia between the tokens -- because it is the same parser Node uses to
// load the file. It needs --experimental-vm-modules, so it runs in a child process; no runner
// change required.
//
// DYNAMIC `import(...)` and `require(...)` are still pattern-matched, because they are call
// expressions whose argument is only known at runtime and so never appear in dependencySpecifiers.
// This is the remaining, stated limit of the check: a dynamic specifier built from a variable, or
// one written with comment trivia inside the call, is not seen. That floor is accepted rather than
// papered over.
