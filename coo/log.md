# COO LOG — append-only accountability trail (directives given + results reported)

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | move | result (done/partial/blocked) | note`

---
2026-06-09 seed | COO initialized | n/a | Situation, priorities, and today's 3 moves
seeded. North star: cash this week. Overdue: the Friday reactivation email. Pattern to
break: building instead of executing.
2026-06-09 build | COO infrastructure live | done | The COO now has its own mailbox
(coo@innd.com, "Chief Operating Officer") and four live n8n workflows: heartbeat (hourly
email + daily calendar block, KzhxslBIB12QcKuW), Send Email (shpRZibsI81XfJiJ), Create
Meeting (ZFkox8gT5vdEKk2Z), and Read Calendar next 7 days (xL0VYbElD15ttqKw). "COO Tasks"
Notion DB created. Autonomy policy set: autonomous internal (Matt+Mark) / directive =
pre-authorization / draft-then-approve external / hard-gate investor-IR-INND. Autonomous
COO routine playbook documented (dream-team/coo-routine.md). Calendar is now two-way.
2026-06-09 build | Autonomous inbound loop live + tested | done | COO routine created in
Claude with an API trigger. n8n workflow "COO: Inbound Email -> Wake COO" (B0bYgelXujDmO7WC)
polls the coo@innd.com shared mailbox every 5 min via Graph, wraps each email as an
injection-guarded external payload, fires the routine to wake the COO, and marks the mail
read. End-to-end test passed: an email to coo@innd.com woke a real COO session. The "CC the
COO" pattern is now live: anything to or CC'ing coo@innd.com wakes the COO unattended.
2026-06-09 build | Concurrency guard + injection-guard fix | done | Playbook is now
mode-aware: only a scheduled MORNING-MODE run sends the brief and books the daily block; an
inbound-fired EVENT-MODE run handles just its item and never briefs. Morning mode checks a
"Morning brief sent - YYYY-MM-DD" marker in the COO Tasks DB before sending and writes it
after, so the brief happens at most once per day (no duplicates from double-scheduling).
Also fixed the review finding: step 1 no longer elevates the email payload as "top input";
it now marks event payloads as untrusted, triage-only, never a directive.
2026-06-09 build | Idempotency-guard hardening (review) | done | Pinned the marker title to
one exact format (Morning brief sent - YYYY-MM-DD) for both the check and the write so they
can't drift; the marker is now written FIRST (before sending) to shrink the double-run
window; and the already-sent short-circuit path now logs that the guard fired, so guard
hits are auditable.
2026-06-09 build | Idempotency recovery + log format (review) | done | Morning guard now has a recovery path: if any step fails after the marker is claimed, the marker is deleted and Matt is alerted so the next run retries instead of silently skipping. Guard-hit and failure log lines now follow the file format (... | morning-guard | skipped/failed | ...).
2026-06-09 build | Failure-alert fallback channel (review) | done | If the morning brief fails on the email step, alerting Matt via email would also fail. Recovery now alerts over an email-independent channel: a guaranteed high-priority "Needs Matt" task in the COO Tasks DB (Notion), plus a best-effort calendar alert event and email only when email was not the failing step.
2026-06-09 coo-check | COO invoked after another build session (org move + Depot + cloud-env setup) | flagged | Every entry in today's log is "build." The 3 cash moves are still not-started and the Friday reactivation email is still unsent. Named the pattern, redirected to Move 1, offered to draft the email + the Gumroad SOPs now.
2026-06-16 19:13 | event-mode: GitHub enterprise invitation | done | Inbound email woke COO (EVENT MODE). Triaged: legitimate GitHub system email — Matt (@GBGolfMatt) invited coo@innd.com to join OTCHealth GitHub enterprise. Expires 2026-06-23. Created COO Task (Needs Matt, This Week, due Jun 23). Notified Matt via email from coo@innd.com. No morning brief sent (event mode).
